# BasicTestLib

This library is developed to be a backbone of all Unit Testing for my upcoming Trojan Hardware Detection Tools

The current functionality includes:
* One class: UnitTestList
* UnitTestList has the ability to append functions to its function vector and run them with RunTests()
* To append a function, it cannot take any parameters
* This library also includes basic assertion support
